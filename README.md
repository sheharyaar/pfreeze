# Pfreeze

> [!WARNING]
> This project is not to be used in production environments. It is intended for educational purposes only. It is my personal project to implement process migration like CRIU on Linux x86\_64 systems.

> This project will **not** be build using any LLMs. Only the Makefile and some parts of the README.md could be generated from them. I _do not hate_ LLMs but I don't prefer to use them for my learning projects. I like to make my own mistakes and fix them.

An independent, experimental and personal implementation of Process Freeze/Unfreeze/Migration inspired by [CRIU](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu) (Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace).
